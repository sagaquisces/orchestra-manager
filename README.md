# OrchestraManager

An app that allows users and administrators to keep track of orchestra personnel.

## User stories
* As a user, I'd like to visit a page to see a list of all orchestra members.
* As a user, I'd like to click an orchestra member's entry in the list to visit their profile page, which should include more details about them.
* As a user, I'd like the option to visit an "About" page that explains what the orchestra is, and what they do.
* As a user, I'd like all data persisted in a database, so it's always there when I need it.
* As an administrator, I want to add new members to the orchestra. (User authentication is not required).
* As an administrator, I want to edit orchestra member profiles, in case I make a mistake, or need to update their details.
* As an administrator, need the option to delete an orchestra member, in case they leave the orchestra.
